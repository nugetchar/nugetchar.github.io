Hi, I'm Thomas!

Welcome on my technical blog :-)

I am a freelance developer and a frontend development instructor [@EEMI](https://twitter.com/EEMI75).
You can also find my blog posts [on my Dev.to](https://dev.to/nugetchar).

Sometimes, with [Florian Garcia](https://github.com/ImFlog), we stream about code on his Twitch channel: [imflog](https://www.twitch.tv/imflog).

If you want to discuss a project or a training in frontend development, feel free to contact me via my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomastoledo/).
